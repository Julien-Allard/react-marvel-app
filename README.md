An original Marvel full stack project.
I used all my current knowledge to bring the best Marvel experience I could.

## Features :

- TypeScript
- consult a Marvel database to get all kind of different Marvel heroes and vilains
- same thing to get a huge panel of Marvel comics
- add characters and comics to your favourites ! They are safely keeped on your local storage
- more to come (better favourite system and account creation/management)
- I took inspiration from different Marvel ressources
